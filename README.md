# Mob Timer

A one-day project for hackday at SALT in juli 2021. The app is meant as a tool to keep track of the driver during mob programming, something we have done almost all of our time here at SALT. 

I chose this project because i was excited about the live aspect of the application. when a user connects to the root path, they are assigned to an empty room. a user may then share the generated link with their fellow mob members, and they will join the session, where they will be presented with a consistent, live updated page.
